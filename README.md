Dockerized Web Application on AWS:

Overview:

This project demonstrates the deployment of a Dockerized web application with a MySQL database on AWS. It includes the setup of a custom VPC, EC2 instances, security configurations, and automated CI/CD processes using Ansible and Amazon ECR. Additionally, it incorporates AMI policies and KMS encryption for enhanced security.

Project Architecture

VPC Configuration:

Custom VPC with public and private subnets.
Route tables, internet gateway, and NAT gateway for secure communication.

EC2 Instances:

Web Server: Deployed in the public subnet with Docker.
Database Server: Deployed in the private subnet with MySQL.

Security:

Bastion Host for secure access to the private subnet.
Security Groups and NACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.

High Availability:

AMIs for quick recovery and Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for the web server.
Data Security & Backup:

Automated MySQL backups.

AWS Secrets Manager for secure credentials management.

KMS Encryption: Encrypts EBS volumes using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

AMI Policies: Ensures secure handling and storage of AMIs.

CI/CD Integration:

Ansible playbook to build, tag, and push Docker images to Amazon ECR.
Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
Files

Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image for the web application.

ansible-playbook.yml: Ansible playbook for building, tagging, and pushing Docker images to Amazon ECR.

Setup and Configuration

Prerequisites

AWS Account: Ensure you have an AWS account and appropriate permissions.

AWS CLI: Installed and configured with your credentials.

Docker: Installed on your local machine.

Ansible: Installed on your local machine.

VPC and EC2 Setup
Create a VPC:

Define a custom VPC with CIDR block.
Create public and private subnets.
Configure Route Tables:

Set up routes for internet and NAT access.

Launch EC2 Instances:

Web Server: Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet.
Database Server: Launch an EC2 instance in the private subnet.
Install and Configure Docker:

Install Docker on the web server EC2 instance.
Deploy your web application as a Docker container.
Install and Configure MySQL:

Install MySQL on the database EC2 instance.
Configure the database and set up automated backups.
Network Security

Set Up Bastion Host:

Launch a Bastion Host in the public subnet.
Configure access to the private subnet via SSH.
Configure Security Groups and NACLs:

Define inbound and outbound rules for your EC2 instances.
High Availability and Scaling
Create AMIs:

Create AMIs for both web and database servers.
AMI Policies: Implement policies to manage AMI creation and access.
Set Up Auto Scaling Group:

Configure ASG for the web server to handle traffic spikes.
Data Security and Backup
Automate Backups:

Use AWS services to automate backups for the MySQL database.
Use AWS Secrets Manager:

Store and manage database credentials securely.
KMS Encryption:

Encrypt EBS Volumes: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt your EBS volumes to protect data at rest.
CI/CD Integration            
Build and Push Docker Images:

Use the provided Ansible playbook to automate the Docker image build and push process.
Configure CI/CD Pipelines:

Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments.
Application Performance and Security
Set Up CloudWatch Monitoring:

Create CloudWatch Alarms for key metrics like CPU utilization and disk I/O.
Implement Distributed Tracing:

Use tools like OpenTelemetry and Jaeger to trace requests across services.
Security Enhancements:

Implement image scanning and conduct regular security audits.
